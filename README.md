# Bonsai.Miniscope
[Bonsai](http://bonsai-rx.org/) package for controlling and acquiring data from head-borne miniscopes for calcium imaging. 

It contains the following nodes: 

- `UCLAMiniscope`: UCLA Miniscope V3 using legacy DAQ firmware. Use this if you have an old DAQ box and have not updated firmware recently.
- `UCLAMiniscopeV3`: UCLA Miniscope V3 using updated DAQ box and firmware. Use this if you are also using the V4 scope.
- `UCLAMiniscopeV4`: UCLA Miniscope V4 with integrated IMU.
    - **NOTE** On some V4 miniscopes, the IMU data will appear jumpy with some or all of the components taking the same value. This is a known issue, and has been addressed in later versions 
      of the Miniscope hardware. See [this issue](https://github.com/Aharoni-Lab/Miniscope-DAQ-QT-Software/issues/23) for more information.

Feel free to submit an issue or PR if you want to add your Miniscope to this package.
